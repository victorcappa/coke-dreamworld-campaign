<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

 
<p align="left">
 <p> This very interesting project allows the user to create murals of 3D objects in physical spaces, combining AR and the Visual Positioning System (VPS) technology, developed by Niantic.
 Not only can the user place 3D models, but we also developed editor tools for scale, style and rotation, allowing for a wide variety of creations. 
 </p>
 
  <h3>Challenges</h3
   <p>
I developed most of the 3D interactions and some UI structures and 3D positioning on VPS was by far the most challenging obstacle for us. This is an amazing technology, but still tough to test and adjust â€” and considering that this was the core of the project, I dedicated a lot of effort to understand it.
